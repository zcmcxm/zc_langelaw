# Personal Website - Zhang Chi

This is my personal website, deployed in November 2024. It represents a major upgrade from my [previous site](https://zcmcxm.github.io/zc.langelaw), now utilizing the Next.js framework for enhanced performance, dynamic routing, and modern server-side rendering capabilities. Additionally, it integrates fully with MongoDB for data management and Cloudinary for optimized image handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** for the web framework
- **MongoDB** for database management
- **Cloudinary** for image hosting and optimization
